# Functions

Functions are a way to organize code into reusable blocks. As a reminder,
functions in Python are "first class objects."

Several built-in functions have been discussed and used previous examples. Just
as important is the ability for users to define their own functions.

## Defining Functions

https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions

> We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary
boundary:

```python
>>> def fib(n):    # write Fibonacci series up to n
...     """Print a Fibonacci series up to n."""
...     a, b = 0, 1
...     while a < n:
...         print(a, end=' ')
...         a, b = b, a+b
...     print()
...
>>> # Now call the function we just defined:
... fib(2000)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597
```

> The keyword `def` introduces a function definition. It must be followed by the
function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements
that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented.

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#def

> The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal;
this string literal is the function’s documentation string, or docstring. (More
about docstrings can be found in the section Documentation Strings.) There are
tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed
documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it’s good
practice to include docstrings in code that you write, so make a habit of it.

## Calling Functions

A *function definition* statement does not execute the function. Executing
(calling) a function is done by using the name of the function followed by
parenthesis enclosing required arguments (if any).

```python
>>> def say_hello():
...     print('Hello')
...
>>> say_hello()
Hello
```

> The execution of a function introduces a new symbol table used for the local
variables of the function. More precisely, all variable assignments in a
function store the value in the local symbol table; whereas variable references
first look in the local symbol table, then in the local symbol tables of
enclosing functions, then in the global symbol table, and finally in the table
of built-in names. Thus, global variables cannot be directly assigned a value
within a function (unless named in a global statement), although they may be
referenced.

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = 10
>>> def fn():
...     print(a)    # local a is not assigned, no enclosing function, global a
referenced.
...     b = 20      # local b is assigned in the local symbol table for the
function.
...     print(b)    # local b is referenced.
...
>>> fn()
1
20
>>> b               # global b is not changed by the function call.
10
```

> The actual parameters (arguments) to a function call are introduced in the
local symbol table of the called function when it is called; thus, arguments are
passed using call by value (where the value is always an object reference, not
the value of the object). [1] When a function calls another function, a new
local symbol table is created for that call.

```python
>>> def greet(s):
...     s = "Hello " + s    # s in local symbol table is reassigned.
...     print(s)
...
>>> person = "Bob"
>>> greet(person)
Hello Bob
>>> person                  # person used to call remains bound to original
object, 'Bob'.
'Bob'
```

The arguments used to call a function cannot be reassigned by the function, but
arguments that reference mutable objects can have their values changed:

```python
>>> def fn(arg):
...     arg.append(1)
...
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> fn(a)
>>> a
[1, 2, 3, 1]
```

## `return` Statement

https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-return-statement

All functions return a value when called.

If a `return` statement is followed by an *expression list*, that expression
list is evaluated and the value is returned:
```python
>>> def greater_than_1(n):
...     return n > 1
...
>>> print(greater_than_1(1))
False
>>> print(greater_than_1(2))
True
```

If no *expression list* is specified, `None` is returned:
```python
>>> def no_expression_list():
...     return    # No return expression list.
...
>>> print(no_expression_list())
None
```

If a `return` statement is reached during the execution of a function, the
current function call is left at that point:
```python
>>> def return_middle():
...     a = 1
...     return a
...     a = 2     # This assignment is never reached.
...
>>> print(return_middle())
1
```

If there is no `return` statement the function returns `None` when it reaches
the end:
```python
>>> def no_return():
...     pass     # No return statement.
...
>>> print(no_return())
None
```

## Name binding and Aliasing Functions

> A function definition introduces the function name in the current symbol
table. The value of the function name has a type that is recognized by the
interpreter as a user-defined function.

```python
>>> something = 1
>>> type(something)
<type 'int'>
>>> def something():
...     pass
...
>>> type(something)
<type 'function'>
>>> something = []
>>> type(something)
<type 'list'>
```

> This value can be assigned to another name which can then also be used as a
function. This serves as a general renaming mechanism:

```python
>>> fib
<function fib at 10042ed0>
>>> f = fib
>>> f(100)
0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89
```

...     inside_fn()
...

outside
inside

  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
