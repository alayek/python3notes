# Classes

> A template for creating user-defined objects. Class definitions normally
contain method definitions which operate on instances of the class.

## Purpose

Classes allow users to define their own objects types. This is useful in
organizing related statements, states, and functions into reusable constructs.

Modules, which also allows for similar organization, create singletons when
loaded by a program using import statements. If a module is imported by two
other modules in a program, those two modules are both referencing the same
module object. Changes to the internal state of the imported module will be
reflected in both of the modules that imported it.

User defined classes, like the built-in classes, allow each *instance* of the
objects derived from the class to have its own state.
